# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend](/udacity-c3-frontend)
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 
2. [The RestAPI Feed Backend](/udacity-c3-restapi-feed), a Node-Express feed microservice.
3. [The RestAPI User Backend](/udacity-c3-restapi-user), a Node-Express user microservice.

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with the RestAPI backends). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman, and then the frontend should integrate.

### Installing Node and NPM
This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (NPM is included) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing Ionic Cli
The Ionic Command Line Interface is required to serve and build the frontend. Instructions for installing the CLI can be found in the [Ionic Framework Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the root of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:
```bash
npm install
```
>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

### Setup Backend Node Environment
You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:
1. Initialize a new project: `npm init`
2. Install express: `npm i express --save`
3. Install typescript dependencies: `npm i ts-node-dev tslint typescript  @types/bluebird @types/express @types/node --save-dev`
4. Look at the `package.json` file from the RestAPI repo and copy the `scripts` block into the auto-generated `package.json` in this project. This will allow you to use shorthand commands like `npm run dev`


### Configure The Backend Endpoint
Ionic uses enviornment files located in `./src/enviornments/enviornment.*.ts` to load configuration variables at runtime. By default `environment.ts` is used for development and `enviornment.prod.ts` is used for produciton. The `apiHost` variable should be set to your server url either locally or in the cloud.

***
### Running the Development Server
Ionic CLI provides an easy to use development server to run and autoreload the frontend. This allows you to make quick changes and see them in real time in your browser. To run the development server, open terminal and run:

```bash
ionic serve
```

### Building the Static Frontend Files
Ionic CLI can build the frontend into static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files. These files can be uploaded to a host to be consumed by users on the web. Build artifacts are located in `./www`. To build from source, open terminal and run:
```bash
ionic build
```
***

### Running CI and CD on Travis 
1. login to travis and connect the wanted repo to travis .
2. configure travis file as mentioned in travis file in udacity3project
3. now you can start pushing your code from any source control to git and to be sure that all changes would be in builded .

### Configuring docker 
"just want to mention that i didnt attach AWS credentials anywhere , you have to configure them in your system variables whether systempath windows or root .profile ubuntu "

#### building the images
we have 4 images we need to configure frontend , user , feed , reverseproxy , all of them would follow the same steps 
go to each directory and run the following commands prepectively 

//udacity-c3-restapi-feed	
**docker build -t aliahmednada/udacity-restapi-feed . **

//udacity-c3-restapi-user	
**docker build -t aliahmednada/udacity-restapi-user . **

//udacity-c3-frontend	
**docker build -t aliahmednada/udacity-frontend . **
